MAYCUS AUCTIONS
An Ember Application

Using Ember libraries, this is the application for a quirky online auction house which would like to sell you bridges.  Functionality includes adding different lots and items (bridges) to those lots.  Some CSS styling, including a boostrap carousel, have been added.  

The purpose of this application was to work with Ember libraries such as handlebars and local storage systems.  The best part was to learn how the MVC model worked with Ember, which I like and dislike for its thorough structure.  Gaining competency of the Ember structure (how routes, models and controllers all work together) was challenging at first, but very rewarding once I came to grips with it.
